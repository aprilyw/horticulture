For our culminating event for the academic year, UChicago Horticultural Society collaborated with the Center for Identity + Inclusion and Civic Knowledge Project to act on the Timuel D. Black Edible Arts Garden at 5710 S. Woodlawn. 

Edible Arts Garden was founded in 2009 in honor of Timuel Black, one of the South Side's major leaders in the struggle for social justice and the author of Bridges of Memory, three volumes of oral histories from Bronzeville. Therefore, in addition to promote edible landscaping as beautiful, this garden also aims to give modern students and visitors a sense of Bronzeville in its heyday, when it was three or four times as densely populated as the rest of Chicago.

The fruits from this event's efforts of weeding and planting will be donated to a local food pantry.
