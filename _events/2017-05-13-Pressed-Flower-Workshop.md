This is our first time collaborated with FOTA to carry out a hands-on event engaging students to create jewelries, bookmarks and tattoos with pressed flowers. We were holding this event at the South Lounge in Reynolds Club, and lots of people got their very own designed necklaces. Some students gave their necklaces to  their moms as a Motherâ€™s Day present.
