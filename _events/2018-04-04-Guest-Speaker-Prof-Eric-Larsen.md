We were lucky enough to get a visit from Prof. Eric Larsen, who is a legendary member of the biology faculty at the college. He talked to us about the different adaptations of plants, enrapturing his audience with a new spin on pollination as a manipulative tactic to get animals to do the plantsâ€™ bidding. His story about how the fig fruit is formed will most likely leave us scared for years, but it was fascinating to hear him tell us about it.
