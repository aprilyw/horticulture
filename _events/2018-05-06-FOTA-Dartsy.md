We were invited to participate in FOTA’s Dartsy, where we had a station for people to paint a flower pot and then have us help them to plant a succulent in it, creating a fun living art piece for a dorm room or apartment. We had a large amount of people interested and were amazed at how beautiful the pots turned out—the artistic abilities of UChicago students know no bounds. In addition, we got to reach out to lots of new people interested in plants and have a presence on campus for people to find out about us.
