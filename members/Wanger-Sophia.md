Hi! Iâ€™m Sophia Wagner, a fourth year in the college studying Economics and Public Policy. I am excited to help get Horticultural Society up and running! 

Your favourite Edible plant: I love growing plants and eating them, and once spent a month working on an organic farm on a small island in Washington!"
