position: Treasurer
bio: "Hi! I’m Peter Laurin, a first year in the college currently studying Biology and English Lit. I am so excited to be a part of the Horticultural Society, and to see what remarkable things we have in store. While I haven’t had much experience growing plants growing up, I love learning about plants and researching their microbiomes."
question: "What's the strangest plant you've ever seen?"
answer: "While I haven’t personally seen this plant, one of the strangest I’ve heard about is Hydnora africana, which doesn’t photosynthesize but instead survives by hijacking the roots of spurges."
