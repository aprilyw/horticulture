name: Marisa Kelath
bio: "I’m a second year majoring in linguistics but with a huge love for plants of all kinds, from weeds growing in abandoned lots to raised beds full of vegetables to the pothos and ferns growing in my dorm room. I have done a lot of work with urban farming and also have a big interest in foraging. Hopefully together we’ll learn all about what’s growing and flowering on campus!"
question: "What’s your favorite spot for plants on campus?"
answer: "The plantings around botany pond are really beautiful, and no matter the season, there’s always something interesting to see there."
