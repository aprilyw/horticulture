name: Charlotte Ring
position: Co-President
bio: "I’m Charlotte, a fourth year studying Geophysical Sciences and Environmental Sciences! I’m known for my greenhouse-like dorm room with fifteen different cacti, succulents, and large houseplants. I’m inspired by nature and always seeking to educate others about the complex world of plants around us. I love learning about the strange science of plant life and applying it to everyday life through edible plants, gardening, and improving the environment."
question: "What’s your favorite tree?"
answer: "My favorite tree is a Bald Cypress. In addition to looking pretty, Bald Cypresses can grow in ponds and swampy areas. In wet environments, they grow “knees” which are little woody offshoots that stick out of the water. Botanists are not sure why these form, but it likely aids in gas exchange, while giving the swamp a cool and spooky feel. Check some out on campus at Botany Pond!"
