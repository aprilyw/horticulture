name: Tristan Laurencio
position: Communication Chair
bio: "I’m a second year majoring in chemistry and east asian languages and cultures with a big interest in food plants, both from my garden at home and in the wild.  Speaking of foraging, I find it really exciting when I find out that there’s a use for a wild plant that I see regularly, especially if I can add it to a meal.  I hope that I can convince everyone that these so-called “weeds” can be just as lovable as other plants!"
question: "What’s your favorite dish/drink using wild edibles?"
answer: "While sunchoke-tots or chicory coffee substitute are both really good contenders, I prefer mullein tea because it’s really easy to make and the taste is somewhat unusual.  This was one of the first wild edibles that I found poking around in my backyard because it’s super easy to identify by its velvety, light-green leaves and flower buds."
