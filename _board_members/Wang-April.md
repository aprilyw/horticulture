name: April Wang
bio: "I’m April, a third year in the college majoring in Computer Science. I’m excited to be a part of UCHS because it’s nice to spend time around living things sometimes! On a more serious note, I’m interested in learning more about what horticulture is and will become. I enjoy frequenting farmers’ markets, running, and drawing plants as well as figure."
question: "What is your favorite flower to draw?"
answer: "Carnations, because just about any scribble can be made into one."
