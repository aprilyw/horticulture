bio: "Hello everyone! My name is Sicely Li and I’m a rising junior at UChicago majoring in Math spec Econ. I’ve been growing plants for 7 years, and I’m very happy to bring this club into existence and share my plant-loving spirits with other students and people in our surrounding community. I love visiting conservatories, walking around plant store and learning floral arrangement."
question: "What is your favorite plant store?"
answer: "My personal favorite is an orchid store in Beijing where the store owners collect wild orchids from the southwestern part of China, ship them all the way to Beijing and set up a really artistic store with all the unique orchids."
