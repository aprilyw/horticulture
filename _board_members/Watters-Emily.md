name: Emily Watters
position: Event Planner
bio: "Hi! My name is Emily, and I’m a second year studying Environmental/Urban Studies and Russian/East European Studies. I love taking care of my many succulents/cacti, and propagating new baby plants from their cuttings. I’m looking forward to also growing herbs in my dorm room this year to make my own tea. Chicago(land) has SO many amazing plant-related spaces and I can’t wait to explore them with the Horticultural Society!"
question: "What’s your favorite plant-related place to visit?"
answer: " I love the Garfield Park Conservatory, but I also think that the Chicago Botanic Garden is amazing and definitely worth the hour-long Metra ride. You walk about a mile through a beautiful forest to get there, and the Botanic Garden itself is absolutely stunning with indoor and outdoor spaces and plants of every variety."
