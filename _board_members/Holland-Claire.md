name: Claire Holland
position: Outreach Officer
bio: "Hello! I’m Claire Holland, a third year majoring in English and Political Science. The more I learn about plants, the more fascinating they become to me--which is why I’m lucky to be a part of the Horticultural Society! I love volunteering for ecological organizations, cloning my succulent army, and learning random plant facts on the internet."
question: "Enough about plants! What’s your favorite fungi?"
answer: "While a lot of fuss has been made about slime mold (look up videos on YouTube if you haven’t seen any yet!), I’ve always had a personal affinity for shelf fungi. Maybe it’s because they’re not very common where I live, but I am continually interested in their unique shape; they actually look like tiny shelves sprouting out of tree trunks!"
