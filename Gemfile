# note to self - this is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# when you want to use a different version, change it below, save file, and run
# 'bundle install', then run run Jekyll with 'bundle exec jekyll serve'.
# (example) gem "jekyll", "~>3.5"

# Also, make sure bundler is installed. If not, run 'gem install bundler'.
# To upgrade, run 'bundle update'.

# We want to maintain a local Jekyll env in sync with GitHub Pages:
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"

# The following plugins are automatically loaded by the theme-gem:
#   gem "jekyll-paginate"
#   gem "jekyll-sitemap"
#   gem "jekyll-gist"
#   gem "jekyll-feed"
#   gem "jemoji"
#   gem "jekyll-data"

# Run 'bundle install' when you're done with this file.

# If you have any other plugins, put them here.
group :jekyll_plugins do
end
