Community member Malik Coburn came to speak to us about his work with permaculture, which includes stays on several farms in California as well as teaching teenagers in Gary, Indiana, about environmental science. He led us in a group activity where we did our best impression of the Chicago wind, then explained us about some of the permaculture principles heâ€™s learned in his work with the subject and had us each pick some that we wanted to incorporate into our daily lives.
