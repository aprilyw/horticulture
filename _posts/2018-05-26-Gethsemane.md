A group of 15 students signed up for a trip to the Gethsemane Garden Center on the North Side of Chicago, where we were given a subsidy from the club to buy plants. From people looking for a succulent to put on a shelf in their dorm room to invested gardeners looking for larger plants, everyone found something to bring home and add some green to their life.
